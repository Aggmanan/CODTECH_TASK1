Overview of the Project 

Project: Design of Finite State Machine 
Overview 

Objective: The VHDL code describes a state machine that detects a specific sequence of input signals (din). The primary purpose of this state machine is to monitor a serial input and assert an output (detect) when a particular sequence is detected. The code implements a sequential detection mechanism where different states represent different stages of sequence recognition.

Key Functions and Technologies
1. Entity Declaration:
      Inputs: din, clk, reset (all std_logic)
      Outputs: detect (std_logic), state (std_logic_vector(2 downto 0))
2. State Machine Design:
      The state machine is defined using a custom type statetype, which includes states a, b, c, and d.
      pr_state and nx_state: These signals hold the present and next states of the state machine.
3. Processes:
      Combinational Process (comb): Determines the next state based on the current state and the input din. It also assigns the appropriate value to detect and state depending on the current state.
      Sequential Process (flfl): Updates the current state (pr_state) based on the clock (clk) and reset signals.

Technologies Used:

1. IEEE 1164 Standard: Utilizes the IEEE std_logic_1164 package for defining and managing logic signals.
2. VHDL and Verilog Constructs: Includes state machine design, process blocks, and signal assignment.
3. Software Used: ModelSim and VIVADO
   
Future Use
This design can be further expanded for more complex sequence detection by adding more states or transitioning conditions. It can be integrated into digital systems where sequence recognition is required, such as communication protocols, error detection, or control systems.
